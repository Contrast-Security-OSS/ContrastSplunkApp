# Contrast Security App for Splunk

Contrast Security App for Splunk allows you to visualize the security of your running application like never before. Contrast Security App for Splunk provides actionable and timely application threat intelligence across your entire application portfolio. Contrast Security instrumented applications self-report the following about an attack – the attacker’s IP address, authenticated username, method of attack, which applications, servers, frequency, volume, and level of compromise. In addition, Contrast Security also provides specific guidance to engineering teams on where applications were attacked and how threats can be remediated. Finally, Contrast Security's Log Enhancement capability extends this visibility into the inner workings of application and user behavior.  Log Enhancers enable users to log anything in an application.
 
All of this intelligence is streamed directly into Splunk, allowing you to quickly and efficiently identify key problem areas and respond to attacks faster than ever before.
